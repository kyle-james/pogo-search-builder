# How to Paste in Pokemon Go
~~You'll need to download an app and change some settings.
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pokerater/id1138347836

~~Once installed, open settings, select General, select Keyboard, select Keyboards, select Add New Keyboard, select PokeRater.

~~Once that is complete, close Settings, open Pokemon Go, re-open Settings, navigate to PokeRater and select it, select Keyboards, and Allow Full Access.

~~You can now use the PokeRater keyboard to paste the text generated into Pokemon Go.

~~In order to do this, you will need to switch your keyboard. You do this by holding the globe icon at the bottom of the on-screen keyboard. Select "PokeNamer - PokeRater", in the bottom left, there's a panel with five icons, select the one that looks like a piece of paper with two horizontal lines on it.

~~Finally, you can press "Replace all:" to paste in the copied string from the string builder.

~~Once finished, you can hold the globe icon on the bottom of the on-screen keyboard again and select your preferred keyboard for every-day use.

~~I'd like to note; I have no affiliation with the developers of Pokemon Go, or the developer(s) of PokeRater. I'm simply trying to solve a problem that I (and others may) have, using tools at my disposal.

~~## Aternitavely, you can use three fingers and hold them on the search bar.
This will open a small menu, and you can tap the paste button.~~

Just copy and paste the generated string into the search bar in Pokemon GO.
